## Technologies Used

## Features
- Two initial DataFrames: `bank_df_1` and `bank_df_2`
- Combined all clients using `concat`
- Merged salary info based on `ClientID`
- Added a new client (yourself) to the dataset

## How to Run
1. Make sure `pandas` is installed: `pip install pandas`
2. Run the Python script
3. View the merged and updated client data
